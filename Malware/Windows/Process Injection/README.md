# Project Injection

Binary is in `x64/Release`. <br>
Usage: `Process Injection.exe <process name>`

## How process injection works
- Get handle to process
- Allocate buffer in process memories with proper permissions
- Inject shellcode to buffer
- Create thread and run shellcode

Simple as that :D
